# Projet_Dulac_Mathieu

This is a project created during my IT master's degree over a period of 4 months, and realized alone.
The goal was to make a clone of the classic game Space Invaders in a 3D environment, using the library Three.js

It may take some times to load because of the royalty-free 3D models I used, which are a bit heavy.
